            <p>The structure is comprised of immaculate white marble. The structure planner Furiburz Sabha picked the lotus as the image regular to Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Jainism. Disciples of any faith are allowed to visit the sanctuary and implore or ponder.
                Around the blossoming petals there are nine pools of water, which illuminate, in common light. It looks fantastic at sunset when it is surge lit.</p>
